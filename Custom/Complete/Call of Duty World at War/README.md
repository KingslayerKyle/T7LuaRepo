## Troubleshooting & Customization Notes

### Custom Weapon CSV File Name
If you've renamed your weapon CSV file from the default (`gamedata/weapons/zm/zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv`), you must update the reference in the HUD script.  
Open `scripts/zm/_zm_t4_hud.csc` and change the path on **line 113** to match your new CSV file name.  
This step is necessary because the script reads the CSV to determine weapon classes for proper UI behavior.

### Ammo Overlap Issue
If your weapon displays excessive ammo and it visually overlaps HUD elements:

- **Preferred solution:** Reduce the total ammo count for that weapon. Extremely high ammo values can cause display issues in the UI.
- **Alternative solution:** If you wish to keep the high ammo value, you can adjust how many ammo pips are displayed per row.

To do this, open:
`ui/uieditor/widgets/HUD/T4AmmoWidget/T4AmmoInfo.lua`

At the top of the file, you'll find a table defining each weapon class.  
Modify the `rowLength` value for the relevant class â€” this controls how many pips are shown horizontally per row.
