## Dumps

This repository contains multiple Lua dumps from different versions of the game.  

- **Complete Lua dumps** - Both PC & PS4 ship versions.
- **PS4 Alpha & Beta** – Early game builds where function and variable names are relatively well-preserved. These provide useful references for understanding original naming conventions.

## Custom HUDs & Widgets

This repository also contains a curated collection of my custom HUDs, UI widgets, and rebuilt Lua files.

- **HUDs** – Complete UI setups and full HUDs.  
- **Widgets** – Individual, reusable UI components.  

## Rebuilt Files

- **Rebuilt** – Lua files that have been cleaned, refactored, and restored to readable/source form.  
  The goal is to provide fully functional, clean, and well-structured versions of the original game assets, as close to the source as possible.

### Contributing to Rebuilt Files

If you’d like to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request. All contributions will be credited.  

#### Guidelines for Contributions

You are welcome to make improvements, **but do not alter the core functionality** of the files. Contributions should focus on cleaning up the decompilation and restoring the files as closely as possible to the original source code.

Acceptable changes include:

- Fixing errors introduced by the decompiler (e.g., in conditions or loops).  
- Renaming variables to meaningful names, preferably using the original developer-style variable names.  
- For reference, the **PS4 Alpha & Beta** sections of this repository contain examples of early files with well-preserved variable names to guide your work.

#### UI Element References

In the decompiled code, you may notice patterns like this:

	local Rounds = CoD.ZmRndContainer.new( self, controller )
	Rounds:setLeftRight( true, false, -32, 192 )
	Rounds:setTopBottom( false, true, -174, 18 )
	Rounds:setScale( 0.8 )
	self:addElement( Rounds )
	self.Rounds = Rounds

This is generated by the UI editor, so both a local variable and `self.` reference are used throughout the file.  

When cleaning up or rewriting elements:

- Prefer using **only `self.` references** for elements.  
- There is no need to assign a local variable and then assign `self.` separately.  
- This keeps the code cleaner, easier to read, and avoids duplicate references.

Example of the cleaned-up version:

	self.Rounds = CoD.ZmRndContainer.new( self, controller )
	self.Rounds:setLeftRight( true, false, -32, 192 )
	self.Rounds:setTopBottom( false, true, -174, 18 )
	self.Rounds:setScale( 0.8 )
	self:addElement( self.Rounds )

Using a single `self.` reference ensures all subsequent references to the element throughout the file are consistent.
